The tidy.txt file contains averaged measurements for an individual in a specific activity,  
extracted from a combined dataset from the wearable Samsung experiment at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. Project details
can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.
Of all the measurements described in the orignal datasets,  only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
measurement are used in the current analysis. The dataset records the averaged results from 6 activities performed 
by 30 individuals.
